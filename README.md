# Replication Code for Disentangling the effects of air pollutants with many instruments 

This code shows how I obtained the results of the paper [Disentangling the effects of air pollutants with many instruments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069621000668), published in 2021 in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 2021.

Since the dataset is not openly accessible, this code does not allow a full replication, but provides details on the implementation. 

It has to run in the following order : 

For data preparation: 
`build_data_health.R`
`build_data.R` 

For data analysis: 
`main.R`

For Figures and Tables in the paper :
`FiguresAndTables`
